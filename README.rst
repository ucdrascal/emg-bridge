Description
===========
This board is for provding an interface between multiple Motion Labs Y03
amplifiers and a DAQ. The board provides RJ25 (6p6c modular jack) connectors
for plugging in up to 8 amplifiers. 5V power from the DAQ is converted to
+/-5V lines, which are directed to the amplifiers. The signal output from each
amplifier is output through a flat ribbon cable to the DAQ. A single ground
electrode can be plugged in to a header pin.
